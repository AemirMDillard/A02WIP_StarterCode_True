![iss056e201248~large](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/66cc6b28-eb04-4e6f-b82f-5b7070028cce)

Welcome aboard captain! Your team at UNC Deep Space Systems wants to build 
a modular mothership capable of swapping power sources on the fly, firing thrusters, and
running science experiments. You'll build tiny modules that communicate cleanly with proper 
encapsulation. You'll use dependency injection to refuel or change your power source mid-mission
without touching mothership code! ðŸš€

```


The **Mothership** coordinates a collection of **AModule**sâ€”most notably a **ThrusterModule**, an **ExperimentModule**, and one injected **IPowerGenerator**. The power generator can be either a **SolarGenerator** or a **FuelGenerator**, both of which *implement* the `IPowerGenerator` interface so the mothership can call `generatePower()` without caring how the power is produced. This generator is provided to the mothership via **dependency injection**, which means you can choose which one to use at runtime by handing the mothership a different generator instanceâ€”no changes to mothership code required.

The mothership is composed of its thrusterModule and experiment modules and may maintain a list of all `AModule` objects to broadcast `statusReport(...)` calls for consistent health reporting. The **Main** class acts as the mission script: it wires everything together, injects the chosen power generator, and triggers high-level actions such as `requestPower()`, `fireThruster(...)`, `runExperiment()`, and reporting routines.



## Inheritance and Interfaces

- **AModule** is an **abstract** base class. It defines shared behavior (e.g., a standardized `statusReport(...)`) that all concrete modules inherit, but it should not be instantiated by itselfâ€”thereâ€™s no such thing as a generic, fully functional module. Marking it *abstract* prevents accidental construction of incomplete objects and communicates design intent.
- **IPowerGenerator** is an **interface** that specifies *what* a power source must do (e.g., `generatePower()`), without specifying *how*. Concrete classes like **SolarGenerator** and **FuelGenerator** implement this interface with their own strategies.



## Dependency Injection (DI) in Practice

The mothership does **not** instantiate its power generator directly. Instead, the chosen generator (e.g., `new SolarGenerator()` or `new FuelGenerator(fuel)`) is **injected** into the mothership, either through the constructor (constructor injection) or through a setter method (setter injection). By allowing the class to take in an interface type, it decouples the mothership from any one power source, enabling a flexible solution with whatever module is available.  It also makes it easier for testing (mock generators), and cleaner upgrades without changing mothership code.

## Novice

This stage is where we lay the **foundation**: base class and associated modules.  In this section, you will work with the following files:

- IModule.java        # Interface that Requires the status update.
- AModule.java        # Abstract base class for all modules
- ThrusterModule.java          # Consumes power to provide thrust

To begin, take a look at IModule:

```
public interface IModule {
   String getName();
   void statusReport(String moduleStatus, boolean isSuccessful);
}
```

The interface defines the functionality necessary for all of our modules.  We can infer that there will be a name instance variable.  Your job is to create the infrastructure necessary to create a category of modules that are interchangable via dependency injection. To implement the IModule interface, we will create an abstract parent class to hold all of our information.  

### Why Mark a Class Abstract?

Use an abstract class when:
1. You want to **share code and a common API** among related subclasses (e.g., one consistent `statusReport(...)`), and
2. It **doesnâ€™t make sense** to create a base instance on its own (a generic AModule isnâ€™t operational).

This keeps your codebase safe (no half-baked base objects), clear (intent is explicit), and DRY (common logic lives in one place).

## AModule (`AModule.java`)

The stub is there for you, but you must fill in the details.

Create an **abstract** class called `AModule` that implements the `IModule` interface.  
This class will be your base class that all other modules will inherit from.  

### Fields and Constructors
- A `String` representing the `name` of the module.

The value for the name should be passed to the constructor as a parameter and set in the body.

### Methods

Remember that abstract classes can contain both abstract and concrete methods. In this case, we don't need any abstract methods, _even though_ we have an abstract class.
This class will have two  **concrete** (non-abstract) methods:

- `String getName()`: a standard getter for the name Variable.  

  `statusReport` with the following parameters:

- `String moduleStatus`
- `boolean isSuccessful`

Your method should first print the name of the module, and the current status, simulating the start of a particular task (initializing, processing, finished, etc):

Example output:

`<moduleName> is Initializing...`

Then it should check to see whether the action was successful by checking the boolean.  

If the action is successful, it should print:
`Action Successful.`

Otherwise, it should print the status as the following string:
`<moduleName> needs immediate attention!`


## ThrusterModule (`ThrusterModule.java`)

Create a subclass of `AModule` called `ThrusterModule`.

### Fields:

-  `int fuel` - which will initially have a value of `100`
- `boolean lastFired` - which will initially be `false`

Note: initialize your fields in your constructor.  These have default values and therefore do not need to be taken in as parameters.

### Methods:

1. Modify `statusReport` to make it print the amount of fuel remaining in thrusterModule as well as whether it  
last fired. Then, call your base implementation to print the remaining information. 

Example output: 

`ThrusterModule: 80 units of fuel remaining. Last fired: Yes`

2. Create a method called `thrust` which takes `int availablePower` as a parameter and returns a boolean.
```java
public boolean thrust(int availablePower);
```
- This method performs a thrust each time it is called. 
- For a successful thrust, you need to have at least 5 units of fuel and 5 units of available power.
- If you have enough fuel and power, use 5 units of fuel and set lastFired to true.
- Each time you thrust, you need to decrement your fuel value
- Print the following line `"ALERT Captain: 5 fuel used for propulsion maneuver."`
- Return `true`
- Otherwise, set lastFired to false, print `"ThrusterModule: Not enough power or fuel to fire."` and return false.

## Adept

In this stage of the assignment, you will create your generators! It is important that we specify *what* a power source must do (e.g., `generatePower()`), without specifying *how*.  Therefore we are going to introduce the IPowerGenerator interface, while classes like **SolarGenerator** and **FuelGenerator** implement this interface with their own strategies:

```java
public interface IPowerGenerator extends IModule{
    int generatePower();
}
```
Notice that `IPowerGenerator` extends the `IModule` interface.  That means that all generators have an **IS-A** relationship with IModule.  The interface extends the functionality to include the requirements from IModule and adds on the `generatePower()` method.


Now, you'll create two classes that both implement `IPowerGenerator` and inherit from `AModule`.

## SolarGenerator (`SolarGenerator.java`)
Change the class header to use the `AModule` parent class and the `IPowerGenerator` interface.

### Methods:
_hint: remember your super keyword.  You'll use it more than once_

0. Constructor: SolarGenerator extends AModule, and you will have to make a constructor to initialize the object.  
1. 
1. `statusReport`:  As is, SolarGenerator inherits statusReport from AModule.  However, we need additional information for our generator classes. Keeping in mind the DRY principle, print out the following solar generator specific line:

`"Solar Generators will never die"`

Then, print the lines from your base implementation.

2. Implement `generatePower` to return a power of 10. 


## FuelGenerator (`FuelGenerator.java`)

### Fields and Constructor:
-  `int fuel` - initialize as a constructor parameter

### Methods:
1. Modify `statusReport` to print the following fuel
   generator specific line before printing the lines from `AModule`'s implementation.

`"FuelGenerator: <fuel> units of fuel remaining."`


2. Implement `generatePower` as follows:

- If `fuel >= 10`, return ***10*** and decrement fuel by that amount. 
- Otherwise, return the remaining fuel and set fuel to 0. 

Simple reference:

| Class          | generatePower()                           | Tracks State | statusReport addsâ€¦               |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ------------ | -------------------------------- |
| SolarGenerator | Constant output (e.g., 10)                | No           | Solar note, then base report     |
| FuelGenerator  | Consumes fuel in chunks (10 or remainder) | Yes (fuel)   | Fuel remaining, then base report |

## Jedi

Now, for the fun part where everything comes together!  We are going to make an experiment module that has a little more complexity.

## ExperimentModule (`ExperimentModule.java`)

### Fields and Constructor:

- `String experimentName`
- `double[] parameters` 
- `double result`
- `boolean hasRun`

The constructor should take in the experimentName and parameters as arguments and then set `hasRun` to false, and `result` to 0;

### Methods:

1. `void runExperiment()` - Iterate through the list of parameters, and increment result by each multiplied by a random number. (use `Math.random()`).  Set hasRun to `true`.
2. `String getSummary()` - This method should return one of the two following lines depending
on the status of `hasRun`: 
```java
return "Experiment not run yet.";
```
```java 
return "Experiment '" + experimentName + "' result: " + result;
```
3. `statusReport` - override the existing implementation to print the following:
`ExperimentModule: {experimentName} completed.` OR `ExperimentModule: {experimentName} pending.`
depending on the status of hasRun. Then, print the lines from your base implementation.

## Mothership (`Mothership.java`)

### Fields:
- Create private instances of `IPowerGenerator`, `ThrusterModule`, `ExperimentModule`, and an ArrayList
of `IModule`. 

Use constructor injection to initialize these fields and add them to your List of IModules:

```java
public Mothership(IPowerGenerator powerGenerator, ThrusterModule thrusterModule, ExperimentModule experimentModule);
```

Thought experiment: Why is ArrayList bound to `IModule`?  In this case the java generics allow us to hold all of the objects that have an **IS-A** relationship with IModule which is what we want.  We could also choose AModule, but that would tightly couple our implementation to existing classes.  Interfaces are more flexible.  

### Methods:
1. `int requestPower()` - this method requests power from your power generator
2. `boolean fireThruster(int availablePower)` - this method uses your thrusterModule to thrust forward
3. `void runExperiment()` - delegate to your experiment module
4. `void printStatusReports()` - iterate modules and call statusReport("Normal", true)


# Mission Control (Main.java)

This is your **launch sequence**: wire the ship together, exercise its core capabilities, and print a few simple readouts so we can verify behavior end-to-end.

### What to build

1. **Choose a power source**  
   Create an `IPowerGenerator` instance. Start with a `SolarGenerator`; later, verify hot-swappability by replacing it with a `FuelGenerator` (e.g., initialized with a reasonable fuel amount). This demonstrates **dependency injection** in action.

2. **Assemble the modules**  
   Construct a `ThrusterModule` (it should initialize with its default fuel and flags) and an `ExperimentModule` (give it a short name and a small array of `double` parameters).

3. **Launch the mothership**  
   Use **constructor injection** to pass the generator, thruster, and experiment into the `Mothership`. After construction, ensure the mothership internally registers these in its modules list.

4. **Request power and report it**  
   Call `requestPower()` on the mothership, store the returned value, and print a one-line message confirming the requested power so the output is human-readable.

5. **Fire the thruster**  
   Call `fireThruster(...)` using the power you just requested. Capture the boolean result and print whether the thruster fired. (If the attempt fails, your output should still clearly explain why.)

6. **Run the experiment**  
   Delegate to the `ExperimentModule` through the mothership, then print the experimentâ€™s summary line.

7. **Print status reports**  
   Finally, call `printStatusReports()` on the mothership to output the health and activity of all modules.


## Extra Credit
Now, it's time to get creative!

Now that you have demonstrated successful mastery of inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and dependency injection you have the option of earning some extra points.
For your implementation to be considered for extra credit it must do the following things.
1. Be passed into `Mothership.java`
2. Inherit from the `AModule` Abstract class
3. Print out something new in its statusReport.  Feel free to be creative on the theme of your module. 
4. Add an overloaded constructor to mothership that will take in another module as a parameter, and add it to the list of `ShipModules`.
5. Add it as a call in the main method

Extra credit will be awarded after the deadline through a manual grading process.
